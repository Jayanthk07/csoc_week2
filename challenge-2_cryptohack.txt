Introduction:

1)Finding flags:  we can see the flag right there, beginner intro->crypto{y0ur_f1rst_fl4g}

2)Great snakes:   As we can see in the source code , it checks for the version of it via sys module , so having a python3 installed is enough to run and get teh flag -->crypto{z3n_0f_pyth0n}
  
3)network attacks: 
from pwn import *
import json

HOST = "socket.cryptohack.org"
port = 11112

r = remote(HOST,port)

def json_recieve():
    line = r.readline()
    return json.loads(line.decode())


def json_send(hsh):
    k = json.dumps(hsh).encode()
    r.sendline(k)


print(r.readline())
print(r.readline())
print(r.readline())
print(r.readline())

request = {
    "buy":"flag"
}

json_send(request)
k = json_recieve()
print(k)


#this code gave me the flag , as instructed in the sample code , i use remote() to start the connection and as the data is transferred i raw bytes ,i had to take care of converting it into bytes before sending and converting back to normal
 after recieving and i had to skip the first 4 lines bcuz as teh port opens the default things like welcome are sent , so as i dont need them , i can skip em
